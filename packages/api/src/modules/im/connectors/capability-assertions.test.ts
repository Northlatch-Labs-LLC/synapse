/**
 * Contract tests for the connector capability layer.
 *
 * Covers:
 *  - `assertSupportedConnectionMode` / `assertSupportedEndpointType`
 *    return clean 4xx-mapped errors (statusCode + stable `code`),
 *    NOT plain `Error` that the Fastify error handler would turn
 *    into a 500. This is the regression the WeCom branch caught:
 *    POST /im/accounts with `{transportKind: "wecom",
 *    connectionMode: "webhook"}` used to surface as 500 instead of
 *    a 400 with `transport_connection_mode_unsupported`.
 *
 *  - Registration coverage: every entry in `TRANSPORT_KINDS` has a
 *    connector registered via the single `register-all` entrypoint.
 *    Guards against the "added enum, forgot to add import" failure
 *    mode where the metadata API silently omits a connector.
 *
 *  - Capability field completeness: each connector's
 *    `TransportConnectorCapability` and `MessageCapabilities` set
 *    every field. Prevents accidentally landing a new
 *    `MessageCapabilities.supportsFoo` field while letting old
 *    connectors fall back to `undefined`.
 *
 * For the "kind missing from registry entirely" path, see the
 * sibling `capability-assertions-unregistered.test.ts` file —
 * keeping it isolated means we don't pollute the registry by
 * `_resetConnectorRegistry()` here.
