/**
 * OpenTelemetry tracing bootstrap (+ optional Sentry error capture).
 *
 * Imported as the VERY FIRST import of src/index.ts so the HTTP instrumentation
 * patches node:http before the Fastify server / outbound HTTP clients are
 * created. (Log↔trace correlation does NOT rely on module patching; it is read
 * live from the active span via the pino `mixin` in infrastructure/logger.)
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE (docs/trace-correctness-remediation-plan-2026-07-12.md §3a/§3b/§4.A):
 * the OTel SDK owns sampling, instrumentation, and export in BOTH configs
 * (Sentry on and off). Sentry is an error-capture client plus an OPTIONAL span
 * consumer behind a deterministic forward rate — it never changes the
 * instrumentation set, the sampler, or OTLP volume. Never re-enable Sentry's
 * auto-performance integrations (see the Sentry.init comment below).
 *
 * Environment variables honored here (identically in both configs):
 *   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT          base OTLP/HTTP endpoint (e.g. http://alloy:4318);
 *                                        traces POST to <endpoint>/v1/traces.
 *   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT   per-signal override, used as-is; either
 *                                        endpoint var enables export.
 *   OTEL_SERVICE_NAME                    service.name resource attribute. FALLBACK
 *                                        "synapse-api"; OTEL_SERVICE_NAME wins over
 *                                        OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES' service.name wins
 *                                        over the fallback (EnvDetector precedence).
 *   OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER(_ARG)            THE OTLP volume knob — the six spec values,
 *                                        mapped by buildSamplerFromEnvVars() below.
 *                                        Matched case-INSENSITIVELY + whitespace-
 *                                        tolerant (normalizeTracesSamplerEnv writes
 *                                        the folded value back to process.env).
 *   OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER                 house three-state gate: unset/`otlp` ⇒ OTLP
 *                                        export; `none` ⇒ no OTLP processor (off
 *                                        switch that keeps the endpoint set);
 *                                        anything else ⇒ diag.error + treat as unset.
 *   OTEL_SDK_DISABLED                    true = no-op tracing; the api still boots
 *                                        and serves; Sentry error capture survives.
 *   OTEL_LOG_LEVEL                       SDK self-diagnostics level (default ERROR).
 *   OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES             honored via envDetector; its service.name
 *                                        now actually wins over the fallback when
 *                                        OTEL_SERVICE_NAME is unset.
 *   OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN        code-defaulted to "http" (stable-only HTTP
 *                                        semconv names, matching undici/@fastify/otel).
 *   SENTRY_DSN                           enables Sentry error capture. Empty = off.
 *                                        Never changes OTLP volume or instrumentation.
 *   SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT                   Sentry environment (default NODE_ENV).
 *   SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE            the Sentry FORWARD rate ([D4]): fraction of
 *                                        traces forwarded to Sentry Performance —
 *                                        event-level, deterministic per trace-id, applied
 *                                        in beforeSendTransaction. DEFAULT 0 = errors-only
 *                                        (no SentrySpanProcessor). NOT a head-sampling
 *                                        rate; OTLP/Tempo volume is never affected.
 *                                        Consumed here and then REMOVED from process.env
 *                                        (the Sentry SDK's env fallback would otherwise
 *                                        re-read the repurposed value as a head rate).
 *                                        Set-but-invalid values log at diag ERROR.
 *   SYNAPSE_TRACE_FIRST_PARTY_HOSTS      extra first-party hosts for egress header
 *                                        propagation (first-party-propagator.ts).
 *   SYNAPSE_TRACE_SAMPLING_SALT          OPTIONAL secret keying the ratio sampler
 *                                        (ingress-trust.ts). Only consulted when a
 *                                        ratio-class OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER is set;
 *                                        unset ⇒ 16 random bytes per process.
 *                                        Required only if >1 api replica serves one
 *                                        public origin (so a browser trace landing
 *                                        on a different replica gets the same
 *                                        answer). Treat as a secret; never logged.
 *
 * If neither OTLP nor Sentry is configured, spans are still created (so logs
 * carry trace_id) but nothing is exported — a safe no-backend default.
 *
 * DOCUMENTED DEVIATIONS from the OTel env spec:
 *   - OTEL_PROPAGATORS is not honored (sdk-trace-node 2.x removed it; our
 *     propagator is policy, not configuration — see docs/trace-propagation-policy.md).
 *   - OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER is a HOUSE three-state gate (unset/`otlp` ⇒ OTLP
 *     export; `none` ⇒ no OTLP processor; anything else ⇒ diag.error + treat as
 *     unset). No installed @opentelemetry package reads it; `zipkin`/`console`/
 *     `logging`/`otlp/stdout` and comma-separated exporter lists are NOT
 *     supported (no such packages installed; OTLP→Alloy is policy, not config).
 *   - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL is not honored: the proto exporter is a pinned
 *     dependency, so the wire protocol is a package change, not an env change.
 *   - Export gate: with NO OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_[TRACES_]ENDPOINT set, NOTHING is
 *     exported (spans still created for log↔trace correlation). This replaces the
 *     spec's default of exporting to http://localhost:4318.
 *   - OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER enum matching is case-INSENSITIVE + whitespace-tolerant:
 *     normalizeTracesSamplerEnv() trim+lowercases it and writes it BACK to
 *     process.env before provider construction, so the SDK's own parallel parse
 *     agrees. Only this enum is folded — never OTEL_SERVICE_NAME/RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES.
 *   - Resource precedence: the house service.name (`synapse-api`)/service.namespace
 *     (`synapse`) are FALLBACK-only, merged BEFORE the detectors. OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
 *     wins over OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES' service.name wins over the fallback — the
 *     installed EnvDetector already implements that precedence, so no trailing
 *     literal merge (which would override the operator) exists.
 *   - diag default level is ERROR, not the spec's `info` (exporter failures log;
 *     healthy operation stays silent). Override via OTEL_LOG_LEVEL.
 *   - Hardened remote-parent sampler arms (§3a, adjudication 1 + A2, amended by
 *     round-2 A3): inbound remote flags are ADVISORY — operator intent wins in
 *     both directions. Every arm is wrapped by IngressTaggingSampler so a
 *     public-edge entry span carries synapse.trace.ingress=public.
 *
 *       OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER        | root        | remoteParentSampled | remoteParentNotSampled
 *       ---------------------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------
 *       unset (default)            | AlwaysOn    | AlwaysOn            | AlwaysOn
 *       parentbased_always_on      | AlwaysOn    | AlwaysOn            | AlwaysOn
 *       parentbased_traceidratio   | keyed ratio | same keyed instance | same keyed instance
 *       parentbased_always_off     | AlwaysOff   | AlwaysOff           | AlwaysOff
 *       always_on/always_off — as specced, no ParentBased wrapper.
 *       traceidratio               | keyed ratio (no ParentBased wrapper — spec)
 *
 *     The spec's default ParentBased arms (AlwaysOn/AlwaysOff) would let a forged
 *     one-line `…-00`/`…-01` header erase or force backend recording; binding both
 *     arms bounds forged flags by the operator's own rate.
 *
 *     R3 (adjudication-2) — ONE ratio function per process: when a ratio-class
 *     sampler is configured, a KEYED accumulator (KeyedTraceIdRatioSampler:
 *     salted HMAC of the trace id) is the ratio for the root arm AND both remote
 *     arms, REPLACING the SDK's public XOR fold. That fold (four 32-bit words
 *     XOR'd vs floor(ratio*0xffffffff)) let a structured id like
 *     `deadbeefdeadbeefcafebabecafebabe` record at every nonzero ratio in O(1) —
 *     no mining. The keyed arm removes that offline, universal, permanent bypass;
 *     the residual is an ONLINE, per-deployment, rate-limited search whose yield
 *     is capped by the nginx edge limiter. The sampler is a cooperative-client
 *     VOLUME knob, NOT a security control — the edge limiter (limit_req/limit_conn)
 *     is the volume bound and Tempo overrides are the last-resort bound. The
 *     unspoofable nginx marker distinguishes Ring-0 from Ring-1 for ATTRIBUTES/
 *     policy only, never for a second sampling math (that would split a trace
 *     that entered via the edge then hopped internally).
 *
 * LOAD-BEARING MECHANISM (not residue — do not "clean up"): the forced CJS
 * requires at the bottom of the provider block (`cjsRequire("http"/"https"/
 * "pg"/"ioredis")`) are what ACTIVATE those instrumentations for this ESM app.
 * registerInstrumentations patches via require-in-the-middle only; a plain ESM
 * `import pg from "pg"` (or `node:http`) bypasses it on Node 22 — no
 * import-in-the-middle loader is registered. Pinned by probe P-A5 (pg/ioredis)
 * and the boot-matrix node:http traceparent check.
 *
 * LAYER RESPONSIBILITIES (§3a/A3 — neither layer claims the other's job):
 *   - this sampler = FORCE/ERASE bounds + keyed ratio (a cooperative-client
 *     volume knob, NOT a security control) + the ingress span attribute;
 *   - nginx (Ring 0) = vendor-state hygiene + the unspoofable ingress marker +
 *     the request-rate bound (limit_req/limit_conn on /api/ and /ws);
 *   - Tempo = the last-resort ingest bound (overrides.defaults).
 *
 * W3C baggage is deliberately NOT propagated (adjudication 6): the Sentry-off
 * propagator is W3CTraceContextPropagator only — no W3CBaggagePropagator — until
 * a real producer exists. Re-adoption convention: docs/trace-propagation-policy.md.
 * (Sentry-on retains Sentry DSC as `baggage` on first-party hops by design,
 * gated off third parties by FirstPartyOnlyPropagator.)
