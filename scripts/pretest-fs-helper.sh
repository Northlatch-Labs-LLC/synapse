# Rebuild the synapse-device-fs-helper Rust sidecar before a test suite that may
# touch it, so editing the Rust source without rebuilding can't silently run
# tests against a STALE binary. cargo's fingerprinting makes this a fast no-op
# when the source is unchanged.
#
# The guarantee on success: the binary the test's resolver will PICK is freshly
# built from the current source. Crucially, this script does NOT re-implement
# the resolver's candidate/priority logic in bash — that mirror drifted out of
# sync with fs-helper-resolve.ts repeatedly. Instead it asks the REAL resolver
# (via fs-helper-resolve-cli.ts, run with tsx) what each profile would pick, and
# only does I/O + cargo here.
#
# PROFILE (1st arg, or FS_HELPER_PRETEST_PROFILE env; default "debug"):
#   - debug: device-runtime tests (newest-wins) → rebuild debug (cheapest).
#   - release: api suite (release-first) passes "release" so the binary it will
#     actually select is the one we just rebuilt.
#
# Decisions (all driven by the resolver's verdict):
#   - ALLOW_MISSING_FS_HELPER=1 → skip entirely (the explicit opt-out, incl. a
#     deliberate env override or a Rust-less host).
#   - SYNAPSE_DEVICE_FS_HELPER_PATH points at a real file that is NOT the path
#     this profile builds → FAIL (the override shadows the fresh build; the
#     handshake only catches a proto mismatch, not same-proto behavioural drift).
#   - cargo present → cargo build; only a real build failure is fatal.
#   - cargo absent → FAIL if the resolver would still pick something (can't prove
#     it's fresh); skip only when nothing resolves (tests skip cleanly).
